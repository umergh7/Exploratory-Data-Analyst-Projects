# ## Introduction
# The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts organization based in Las Vegas, USA and is regarded as the largest mix martial arts (MMA) promotion. MMA is comprised of all styles of fighting such as boxing, kickboxing, grappling, and jiu jitsu. It's a sport that's highly unpredictable given the nature of fighting but I'd like to understand the following:
# 
# 1. Does age play a factor in winning?
# 2. How does the fighter's height affect performance?
# 3. In what parts of the world is MMA most popular? And what fighting style originates from what part of the world?
# 4. What is the most popular way to win a fight?

# ## Lets load, understand, and clean our data

# In[39]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as plt


# In[40]:


pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)


# In[ ]:


df = pd.read_csv('UFC Metrics.csv')
df


#  # Understanding the Data:
#     
# This dataset contains a list of all UFC fights since 2013 up until now . Each row represents a single fight - with each fighter's previous records summed up prior to the fight. Blank stats would mean that it's the fighter's first fight since 2013 which is where granular data for UFC fights.
# 
# Important Columns:
# - BPrev: Previous fights by 'Blue' fighter
# - B_Age: Age of 'Blue' fighter
# - B_Height: Height of 'Blue' fighter
# - B_Weight: Weight of 'Blue' fighter
# - B_Location: Location of 'Blue' fighter
# - B_Hometown: Hometown of 'Blue fighter
# - RPrev: Previous fights by 'Red' fighter
# - R_Age: Age of 'Red' fighter
# - R_Height: Height of 'Red' fighter
# - R_Weight: Weight of 'Red' fighter
# - R_Location: Location of 'Red' fighter
# - R_Hometown: Hometown of 'Red fighter
# - Date: Date of the fight
# - winby: How did the fighter win the fight (decision, submission KO etc.)
# - winner: Who was the winner of the fight?
#

#Lets take a closer look at our data
df.describe(include ="all")


# In[18]:


df.info()


# In[19]:


df.describe(include=['O'])


# ## Interesting Initial Observations 
# 1. The most common hometown is Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This makes sense considering MMA is one of the biggest sports on Brazil, behind football of course.
# 2. 'Red' Fighter won more fights, (867/1477) about 59% of fights. This generally makes sense considering the 'red' fighter is usually a higher rank.
# 3. Most fights were also won via Decision.
# 4. Most fights were in 2016.

#Cleaning our data
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 10)
df.isnull().sum()


# # Missing Values
# As we can see above, we have several null values. The missing values that are pertinent are for columns age and height. To maximize the amount of data we have, instead of deleting the rows with null values for age and height, we can replace it with median values. 

# In[29]:


#Blue Fighter
df['B_Age'] = df['B_Age'].fillna(np.mean(df['B_Age']))
df['B_Height'] = df['B_Height'].fillna(np.mean(df['B_Height']))

#Red Fighter
df['R_Age'] = df['R_Age'].fillna(np.mean(df['R_Age']))
df['R_Height'] = df['R_Height'].fillna(np.mean(df['R_Height']))


# In[30]:


#Checking that there are no null values
df[['B_Age','B_Height','R_Age','R_Height']].isnull().sum()


# # Mission Statement: What are we trying to accomplish?
# I'd like to gain a better understanding to the following questions
# 1. Which corner usually gets more victories? (Red/Blue)
# 2. How does Age and Height have an affect on the result of the fight?
# 3. What is the most common way of winning a fight?
# 4. What is the most popular training location for fighters?
# 5. Analyzing different techniques used in different rounds?
# 6. How dominant are the famous 'Dagestani' fighters?

# # Which corner usually gets more victories? (Red/Blue)

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
data = df['winner'].value_counts()

# # How does height influence winning?

# Height needs to be broken down by weight division, these are the UFC weight divisions & their respective weights
#

# In[129]:


redwinners = df[["B_Height", "R_Height", "winner"]][df['winner'] == 'red']
redwinners['R_Difference'] = redwinners['R_Height'] - redwinners['B_Height']

bluewinners = df[["B_Height", "R_Height", "winner"]][df['winner'] == 'blue']
bluewinners['B_Difference'] = bluewinners['B_Height'] - bluewinners['R_Height']

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(30,10))
sns.histplot(redwinners['R_Difference'],ax=ax[0], color ='r', kde = True)
sns.histplot(bluewinners['B_Difference'],ax=ax[1], color ='b', kde = True)
plt.suptitle("Height difference for fighters that won", fontsize =50)
plt.show()


# The above histograms look at the height difference for fighters that won (both blue and red corners). As expected the mean value is closer to 0. This makes sense because fighters must fight in the same weight division and won't vary too much in height. However, one can see here that the fighters that won generally have a height advantage. A height advantage means that the fighter likely has a greater reach which can help the fighter keep distance.

# # Most common way of winning a fightÂ¶
# Now, let's talk about how the fighters are winning. The three most popular ways to win in an MMA fight are:
# 1. DEC: Decision (Dec) is a result of the fight or bout that does not end in a knockout in which the judges' scorecards are consulted to determine the winner; a majority of judges must agree on a result. A fight can either end in a win for an athlete, a draw, or a no decision.
# 2. SUB: also referred to as a "submission" or "tap out" - is often performed by visibly tapping the floor or the opponent with the hand or in some cases with the foot, to signal the opponent and/or the referee of the submission
# 3. KO/TKO: Knockout (KO) is when a fighter gets knocked out cold. (i.e.. From a standing to not standing position from receiving a strike.). Technical Knockout (TKO) is when a fighter is getting pummeled and is unable to defend him/herself further. The referee will step in and make a judgement call to end it and prevent the fighter from receiving any more unnecessary or permanent damage, and call it a TKO

winby = df['winby'].value_counts()
ax = winby.plot(kind='pie', figsize=(7,7), autopct='%1.0f%%', shadow = True, legend=True, title='Fight Conclusion', ylabel ='', labeldistance=None, fontsize=20)
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1.02), loc='upper left')
plt.show()


# In[136]:


g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col='winby')
g.map(plt.hist, 'R_Age', bins=20,COLOR='r')


# In[138]:


g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col='winby')
g.map(plt.hist, 'B_Age', bins=20,COLOR='b')


# as seen here, one thing consistent accross both blue and red fighters, is that most fighters aged 20-27 are winning by decision. This makes sense considering they lack experience in executing KO's and submissions

# In[175]:


RedFLocation = df['R_Location'].value_counts().head(10)
BlueFLocation = df['B_Location'].value_counts().head(10)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(30,10))
RedFLocation.plot(kind ='bar',  ax = ax[0], title ='Hometowns for Red Fighters', fontsize = 30,)
BlueFLocation.plot(kind ='bar', ax = ax[1], title ='Hometowns for Blue Fighters', fontsize = 30,)


# In[176]:


# For both red and blue, most fighters originate out of Brazil. Makes sense, consistnent with Brazilian sports.
